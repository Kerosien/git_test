To force push to github // git push -u origin +main

Commands related to a remote repository // 
git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git 
git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)
git push . (pushes local repository to github after a commit)
git pull . (pulls any reacent commits from github to the local repository)

Commands related to the workflow //
git add . (adds everything in the current directory to be added to the staged queue)
git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"

Commands related to checking status or log history //
git status (looks to see if there is modified or staged files)
git log (shows a log of commits made to the repository)

The basic Git syntax is // 
program | action | destination.

For example,

git add . (is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory)
git commit -m "message" (is read as git | commit -m | "message")
git status (is read as git | status | (no destination).)
